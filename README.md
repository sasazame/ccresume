## Installation

### Via npx (Recommended)

```bash
npx @sasazame/ccresume@latest
```

### Global Installation

```bash
npm install -g @sasazame/ccresume
```

## Usage

Run the command in your terminal:

```bash
ccresume
```

Or if using npx:

```bash
npx @sasazame/ccresume@latest
```

### Command Line Options

#### ccresume Options

```bash
# Hide specific message types
ccresume --hide              # Default: hides tool and thinking messages
ccresume --hide tool         # Hide only tool messages
ccresume --hide thinking      # Hide only thinking messages
ccresume --hide user         # Hide only user messages
ccresume --hide assistant    # Hide only assistant messages
ccresume --hide tool thinking user  # Hide multiple types

# Filter to current directory
ccresume .

# Show help
ccresume --help
ccresume -h

# Show version
ccresume --version
ccresume -v
```

#### Passing Options to Claude

All unrecognized command-line arguments are passed directly to the `claude` command when resuming a conversation.

```bash
# Pass options to claude
ccresume --dangerously-skip-permissions

# Multiple options
ccresume --model opus --dangerously-skip-permissions

# Combine ccresume and claude options
ccresume --hide tool --model opus 
ccresume . --hide --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning**: Since unrecognized arguments are passed to claude, avoid using options that conflict with ccresume's functionality:
- Don't use options like `--resume` or something like that changes claude's interactive behavior

## Requirements

- **Node.js** >= 18
- **Claude Code** - Must be installed and configured

## üêû Known Issues

Below are known issues and limitations. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!

| No. | Title | Description | Issue |
|:---:|:------|:-------------|:-----|
| 1 | **Incomplete conversation history restoration on resume** | When resuming with ccresume, sometimes, only the tail end of the history is restored. Although the interactive `claude -r` can restore full history. Workaround: use `claude -r` interactively or `claude -c`. | [#2](https://github.com/sasazame/ccresume/issues/2) |
| 2 | **~~Restore original console state after exiting ccresume~~** | ~~Exiting `ccresume` leaves the chat selection interface visible and hides previous terminal content.~~ **This is fixed in v0.3.1**: Terminal scrollback buffer is now preserved when exiting. | [#3](https://github.com/sasazame/ccresume/issues/3) |
| 3 | **Resume ordering may be incorrect** | For performance issue, `ccresume` sorts logs by file system timestamps (not chat content), so display order may not match actual chronology after migration. Workaround: preserve file timestamps. | ‚Äì |
| 4 | **Windows native terminal limitations** | On Windows native terminals, interactive features may have limited functionality due to terminal input handling differences. Temporarily, in the Windows native environment, a warning message will be displayed before startup. | [#32](https://github.com/sasazame/ccresume/issues/32) |
